 Binary Classification Web App using Streamlit and Python
 
 June 21 Update:
 Currently still using streamlit. But fast page seems like an better option. Will take a look at that. 
 Also, still working on the error "Cannot convert String to float: '?'." Have been trying to solve it since the yesturday. eh.
