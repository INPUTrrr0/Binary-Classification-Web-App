# Binary Classification Web App 
 Binary Classification Web App using Streamlit and Python
 
 Hello. Welcome to this so called "Development Log". This is a sacarstic name, consequence of this "project" taking way longer than I have planned. Since I am doing a lot of trial and error at this point, might as well keep a log for future references. 
 
 
 
 
 
 June 21 Update:
 Currently still using streamlit. But fast page seems like an better option. Will take a look at that. 
 Also, still working on the error "Cannot convert String to float: '?'." Have been trying to solve it since the yesturday. eh.
